When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when I am working from different places and/or with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Some commits have wrong code or unnecessary files - I don't need them in my remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	branch only for local developing, forks for copying remote repositories from one person to nother on github, cloning is copying remote or local repositories to local mashine.
