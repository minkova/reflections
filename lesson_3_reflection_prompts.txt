When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when I am working from different places and/or with someone.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	
	Some commits have wrong code or unnecessary files - I don't need them in my remote repository.
